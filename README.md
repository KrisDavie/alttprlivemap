# ALTTPR Frame Rate Checker

A quick and dirty web tool to check the frame rate of a running ALTTPR game

This tool requires SNI.

Counts are only accurate at higher polling rates and while you are in-game.

## How to use:
1. Start SNI - (q)usb2snes will NOT work
2. If you have multiple devices, select the device you want to connect in the menu in the top right.
3. Set the polling rate in the box below (lower poll rates have more error).
4. Load an ALTTPR seed in a non-completed save and enter the game (link's house or sanc is fine)
5. Idle in the game - save and quits will stop the counter and give innacurate results
6. Click the "Reset Counters" button to start counting frames.

The longer you run the counter, the more accurate the FPS will be.
